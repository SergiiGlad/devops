# Cloud functions

## Create single-purpose functions that respond to events without a server or runtime

You don't have to worry about servers or runtime binaries. 
You just write your code in JavaScript for a Node.js environment that GCP provides and then configure when it should fire.
There's no need for you to pay for servers either.
You just pay whenever your functions run, in 100 millisecond intervals.
Cloud Functions can trigger on events in Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub, or in HTTP call.
