Who are you looking at? This is Ada Lovelace, credited with being the first computer programmer. She worked with mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage, who proposed the Analytical Engine. Her interest in the Analytical Engine lead to translating a paper on the machine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, adding her own extensive annotations. These notes are considered the first computer program - an algorithm designed to be carried out by the machine. She developed a vision of the capability of computers, going beyond number crunching, and examined how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
