## DevOps Basics

What Is DevOps?
**DevOps** - is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together through the entire service lifecycle; from the design and development process all the way to production support. DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use of many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work. https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/


#### Kaizen’s Guiding Principles

* Take action to contain and correct root causes of problems

#### Golden Image to Foil Ball

**Provisioning** is the process of making a server ready for operation, including hardware, OS, system services, network connectivity.

**Deployment** is the process of automatically deploying and upgrading applications on a server.

**Orchestration** is the act of performing coordinated operations across multiple systems.

**Configuration management** is an overarching term dealing with change control of system configuration after initial provision, but is often also applied to maintaining and upgrading application and application dependencies. 

**Imperative** - also known as “procedural,” this is an approach where commands desired to produce a state are defined and executed. 

**Declarative** - also known as “functional,” this is an approach where you define a desired state and the tool converges the existing system on the model.

**Idempotent** - the ability to execute the CM procedure repeatedly and end up in the same state each time. 

**Self service** - is the ability for an end user to kick off one of these processes without having to go through other people.
