Linux Package Interview Questions | Linux YUM Interview Questions

1) What does ‘ivh’ represents in rpm -ivh <PackageName> command?

ANS: i – install
v – verbose mode
h – hash mode where it would print ## characters as the installation progresses

2) What is the difference between rpm -F <PackageName> and rpm -U <PackageName>?

ANS: rpm -F = Basically freshens a package which in turn upgrades an existing package, otherwise doesn’t install it if an earlier version not found.
rpm -U = Upgrades an existing package if exists otherwise install it.

3) How to find to which package the “ls” commands belongs to (to find out package responsible for this command)?

ANS : #rpm -qf /bin/ls {this would tell about the package to which this command (binary file) belongs to if installed by that package}

4) How to find out the configuration files installed by a package (take into consideration of the “coreutils” package)?

ANS : # rpm -qc coreutils

To list out only the document files installed by coreutils package:-
# rpm -qd coreutils

To list out all the files installed by this package:-
#rpm -ql coreutils
OR
#rpm -q – -filesbypkg coreutils

To list out dependencies :-
#rpm -qR coreutils

To list out packages which require this package:-
#rpm -q –whatrequires coreutils

To find out more information of this package:-
#rpm -qi coreutils

To find out any scripts executed by this package:-
#rpm -q –scripts coreutils

Similarly, to find details of package which is not yet installed:

List Files In Package:
#rpm -qpl <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

{The list would show up files which would get added to system after installing package}

List Only Config Files:
#rpm -qpc <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Only Document Files:
#rpm -qpd <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Out Dependancies For This Package:
#rpm -qpR <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Details For This Package:
#rpm -qpi <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

5) How do you find out all the packages installed on a RHEL system(server)?

ANS : – /root/install.log > this would only lists packages installed during deployment of the system. Packages installed later would not be listed here.
– Otherwise, run the command #rpm -qa > this would query rpm database and prints out names respectively.

– In RHEL5.x we can check the file : /var/log/rpmpkgs to find out all packages on the system. However, this file is deprecated in RHEL6.

– Note: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the daily cron file to create /var/log/rpmpkgs is provided by the rpm-cron package, available in the optional repository, not the main ‘rpm’ package. So, if you do not install the package, /var/log/rpmpkgs is not available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. (Ref – https://access.redhat.com/solutions/23743)
