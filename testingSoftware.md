## To deploy software from a CI/CD pipeline you would need to have at least:

  * __Unit tests__ : to test individually each smallest software component
  * __Integration tests__ : to test a bigger chunk of software components together
  * __Acceptance tests__ : to ensure business expectations are met ( as part of the acceptance test-driven development methodology )
  * __End-to-end tests__ : to ensure every software component in the chain is working as expected, in a production-like environment
  * __Performance tests__ : to ensure the performance is not degraded by a fix or a new feature
  
## TDD Test Driven Development

Writing test also helps you think the problem you're rying to solve and clarifies your thinking. With __TDD__, it simply goes one step further: you write the test first, then the code.
