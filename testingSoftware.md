## To deploy software from a CI/CD pipeline you would need to have at least:

  * __Unit tests__: to test individually each smallest software component
  * __Integration tests__: to test a bigger chunk of software components together
  * __Acceptance tests__: to ensure business expectations are met ( as part of the acceptance test-driven development methodology )
  * __End-to-end tests: to ensure every software component in the chain is working as expected, in a production-like environment
  * __Performance tests: to ensure the performance is not degraded by a fix or a new feature
