# Jenkins

__Jenkins__ is an extendable open source continuous integration and automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery
_Kohsuke Kawaguchi â€” the creator Jenkins, before was Hudson_ 

__Jenkins__ is an open-source automation server that lets you flexibly orchestrate your build, test, and deployment pipelines. Jenkins allows developers to iterate quickly on projects without worrying about overhead issues that can stem from continuous delivery.


## Pipeline

A __pipeline__, as we know it, is divided into different chain links called __stages__. 
Those __stages__ can contain single or multiple __jobs__.
A __job__ describes the __commands__ that need to be executed to achieve the desired outcome.
A __command__ can be a binary or a complex toolchain.
