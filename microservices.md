It's about architecture, design, and process.
>> We like to joke that the job of an architect is to draw rectangles and point arrows at them.
>> Which to a certain extent it's true, that is an important step in designing complex systems.
>> The starting point for any software development is to figure out what the software is supposed to do, who your users are, and why this is important.
>> You will begin with this requirements gathering phase.
>> Once you understand your software's requirements and your users, you can start laying out the overall design.
>> In software, this is a process of decomposition, breaking the big thing, your program, into smaller manageable units that you can start programming.
>> In a modern cloud-based system, it is considered a best practice to break your application into microservices.

__Microservices__ refers to an architectural style for developing applications.
__Microservices__ allow a large application to be decomposed into independent constituent parts, with each part having its own area of responsibility.

>> To serve a single user or API request, a microservices based application can call many internal microservices to compose its response.
>> This has a significant effect on the agility of the application in aspects such as development speed, deployment, and monitoring.
