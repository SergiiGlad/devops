DevOps is a way to deliver software with shared pain and responsibility.

#### What is the difference between Pipeline and Project in Jenkins?

The main difference between any job and a Pipeline Job is that the Pipeline Scripted job runs on the Jenkins master, using a lightweight executor expected to use very few resources in order to translate the pipeline to atomic commands that execute or send to the agents.

### CI - Continuous Intergation

Development project often consists of many developers, all working on individual features and code. Eventually the individual work needs to be brought together and combined into a single code base. Individual developers should be testing their code as they work, but that code still needs re-verifying when it's part of the full codebase.

### Continuous Development ( CICD )

**Continuous development is the natural progression of iteration times shrinking into insignificance. Thtough heavy use of automation, flexible infrastructure and modular architecture, software development leaders have come to the point where each code change is its own deploymnet.

  * **Continuous Integration**: Merging of development work with code base constantly so that automated tetsing can catch problems early
  * **Continuous Delivery**: Software package delivery mechanism for releasing code to staging for review and inspection
  * **Continuous Deployment**: Relies on CI and CD to automatically release code into production as soon as it is redy. Constant flow of new features into production

Continuous Integration ----> Continuous Delivery ----> Continuous Deployment


**The microservice-based approach to architecting an application uses an API to expose discrete functions of the application; these functions are know as _microservices_**
